GIMP    = .xcf files made using GIMP 2.10 in Ubuntu
Labels  = individual labels with each on an 8.5 x 11 inch (A4) background

BenEaters6502   = All the labels for Ben's 6502 project. This includes both MOS and WDC versions of the 6502/22.

Note: you may need to try different PDF viewers and print settings to get these to print right. I use the default “Document Viewer” that came with Lubuntu. I have tried printing from Firefox, Ocular, and GIMP directly. With the A4 sized background I get good print results from most. Without the A4 sized background the Document Viewer is the only one that prints at the correct size. I am using the same print tools I use for ink transfers when I'm etching PCB's.
  I cut these out, and glue them on with stick-type school glue. It holds but is easy to clean off too. The best looking results I have achieved were done using HP brand photo paper designed for toner printers, but used in a laser printer. This paper also sticks to the chip better. I use standard printer paper most of the time though.

 Inside the GIMP  standard .xcf file there are more labels that I did not include in PDF form. These are an older style from back when I made labels with the text facing the pins on each side. Now I make all text face the same side.
  I use the GIMP file to make sheets with lots of labels to print at once. I start off with the datasheet pinout in view. I duplicate one of the blank templates with the right pin count. In both .xcf files there are tools and examples in the various layer groupings (folders). I usually just copy the whole folder with all layers. This makes it easier because all of the different text sizes and formats will be copied already. I delete all but the last letter of text in each copied layer (to retain the old formatting) and use it as my starting point. I find it easier to make the standard file’s labels with horizontally oriented text and the wide chip labels with vertical text. This gives enough room for functional text for standard and more readable text with the wider chips.
  It should go without saying...but I will anyways, assume everything is wrong and double check the pinouts before using them. If you find an error before I do, feel free to let me know. I’m sure I’ll figure it out eventually and update it. Hopefully this is useful to you, but I make these for myself.
